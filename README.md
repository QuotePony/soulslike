Foundry VTT system for Soulslike RPG.

Made by Quote!

## Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Make your changes inside the `src/` TypeScript sources.
3. Run `npm run build` to emit the production-ready files under `dist/`.
4. Point `system.json` at the compiled assets (already configured for `dist/soulslike.js`).
